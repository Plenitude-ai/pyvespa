METHODS: A cohort of 17,880 <hi>breast</hi> <hi>cancer</hi> patients, newly diagnosed between 1998 and 2009, was identified from English <hi>cancer</hi> registries (from the National <hi>Cancer</hi> Data Repository).

Methods In a cross-over design, we randomized 96 women who produced ≥10 μL NAF <hi>to</hi> a high- or low-soy diet for 6-months. During the high-soy diet, participants consumed 2 soy servings of soy milk, tofu, or soy nuts (approximately 50 mg of isoflavones/day); during the low-soy diet, they maintained their usual diet. Six NAF samples were obtained <hi>using</hi> a FirstCyte© Aspirator. Estradiol (E2) and estrone sulfate (E1S) were assessed in NAF and estrone (E1) in serum only <hi>using</hi> highly sensitive radioimmunoassays. Mixed-effects regression models accounting for repeated measures and left-censoring limits were applied. Results Mean E2 and E1S were lower during the high-soy than the low-soy diet (113 vs. 313 pg/mL and 46 vs. 68 ng/mL, respectively) without reaching significance (p=0.07); the interaction between group and diet and was not significant. There was no effect of the soy treatment on serum E2 (p=0.76), E1 (p=0.86), or E1S (p=0.56). Within individuals, NAF and serum levels of E2 (rs=0.37; p<0.001) but not E1S (rs=0.004; p=0.97) were correlated. E2 and E1S in NAF and serum were strongly associated (rs=0.78 and rs=0.48; p<0.001).
